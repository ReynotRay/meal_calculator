Meal Calculator 

For your finished project you need to be able to:

Create diner objects which represent a single diner.<br>
Add dishes to a diner's meal<br>
Total up the cost of all of the diners' meals<br>
Add a fixed tax percentage to the total bill<br>
Add a percentage tip to the total bill<br>
Split the bill fairly among the diners<br>
Each diner should pay the tax on their own food<br>
Each diner should pay an equal share of the tip<br>
If you choose to round the amounts, you may notice that the sum of the amounts does not equal the total bill amount anymore.<br>
Don't worry about that, or distribute the discrepancy in a fair way for an extra challenge.<br>
Print out a total bill<br>
Print a breakdown for what each diner owes<br>

questions
where can i console.log
lots of jquery 
should i create a separate file for jquery functions?
is division correct?
should i multiply total value by 0 for reset?
how ot do math like tip and tax
